We propose to connect the upcoming “supergeeks” generation, in a concerted common language [English], through a specific children network designed to help them initiate contact and exchange, revolving around relevant subjects, initially, software use and improvement.

There are over 2 million Sugar users in the world and their average age is 6 to 12. Sugar was conceived at MIT Media Lab as children software that helps children learn to learn. It has been distributed independently and in conjunction with the OLPC project since May 2006. 

There have been some projects to evaluate the efficiency of the deployments but not much relevant information gets to the software developers. Sugar Labs needs quality feedback from its users [children] in order to make clear to its developers what needs to be fixed and what needs to be improved.

This project aims toward the creation and maintenance of a Sugar Users Network. 



Sugar Users Network 



Free Software is a culture and a process. Started at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT in the 80's. It proposes that users have certain rights, for instance the ability to study, modify and share the software they use in their computers. 



It is developed by millions of people that use it while coordinating their work in global communities. The community goal is to improve and distribute a common intellectual good (in our case Sugar software infrastructure). Users are not merely consumers but also creators. 



The Free Software process today provides much of the software that companies like Google use, sustains companies like Red Hat. More importantly it provides a healthy technology ecosystem where knowledge is shared. 



It is in this healthy intellectual environment that a community of children hackers (explorers of the limits of what is possible) could flourish. Children sharing knowledge in a common language, united in the common goal of extending what they can do with their computers. </body></html>
